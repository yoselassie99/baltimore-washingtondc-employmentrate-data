# Comparing Employment Rate in Baltimore City, MD and Washington D.C. with Opportunity Atlas Data

## Background
Employment rate is used to analyze the social and economic health of neighborhoods and cities. While this is not the only tool to determine social welfare, it is one of the oldest and easiest tools to analyze. High employment rates are typically associated with prospering communities while low employment rates are associated with crime and instability. 

President Trump frequently cites lowest black unemployment rate as an achievement for his presidency. However, this fails to properly determine the economic health of black communities in the United States cities. Although highest black unemployment rate is an achievement, it may not seem as monumental when compared with the unemployment rate of their white neighbors.

This project will investigate and compare the employment rate for black and white residents of Washington D.C. with their peers in Baltimore, MD. The data will be extracted from Opportunity Atlas, an online database that tracks millions of Americans from childhood to adulthood.
